# Developer Guide (Draft)

This guide aims to define shared workflows and best practices for developers working on City of Austin projects.

While it's a draft, we encourage teams to adopt these practices, ask questions or share feedback in the #developers channel of the austininnovation Slack, and to contribute changes and additions using GitHub issues and pull requests.

If your team decides to use this guide, link to it from your project's README!
