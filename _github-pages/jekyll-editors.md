These are some recommended ways of editing a GitHub Pages site, from the least complicated to the most powerful. Certain sites may be optimized for a particular editor, so always check the README!

## :clipboard: GitHub

The shortest route to editing a GitHub Pages site is directly on GitHub, where you can also preview the rendered Markdown and write a commit message.

## :page_facing_up: Prose

[Prose](http://prose.io/) is another simple way to edit a GitHub Pages site. You grant it access to your GitHub repositories, select the repo you want to edit, and any changes you make are automatically pushed back to GitHub.

## :book: Siteleaf

[Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com) is a full-featured Jekyll-based content management system. It's free to use with GitHub Pages, but certain features, like custom themes, require a paid plan.

With a paid plan, you can also preview changes to your site before they're published. It's recommended that you get a developer's help to complete the initial setup.

## :books: Git or GitHub Desktop

The most powerful way to edit a GitHub Pages site by editing the repository using command-line `git` or GitHub Desktop. This method is recommended only if you're inclined to learn how to use these tools.
