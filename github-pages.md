GitHub Pages is way to host a website about a project or team directly from a GitHub repository, using just text files!

### :mag: Using This Guide

This guide is intended as a beginner-friendly introduction to the GitHub Pages ecosystem. Rather than a provide comprehensive how-to, it's designed to point you in the direction of the pieces and tools that you might want to use, most of which have their own valuable documentation.

### :notebook: Quick Glossary

* **GitHub** is a platform for hosting code and collaborating on projects, including open source software.
* **GitHub Pages** is a GitHub feature that allows a website (i.e. HTML files) to be published directly from a code repository.
* **Git** is a version control system for tracking changes to files, including the files of a GitHub Pages website. It’s not necessary to use Git to edit a GitHub Pages website.
* **Jekyll** is the open source “static site generator” that powers GitHub Pages: it transforms plain text files into a website, and supports features like themes and templates.
* **Markdown** is set of simple rules to format text written for the web. Jekyll transforms Markdown into HTML so you don’t have to read or write code.

### :nut_and_bolt: How It Works

With a typical GitHub Pages site, any changes you save (aka “commit”) to the repository will automatically be built by Jekyll, and the resulting HTML files will be published as a website at either `https://cityofaustin.github.io/your-repo-name/` or a custom domain, if configured.
